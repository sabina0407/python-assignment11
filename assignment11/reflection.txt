Task 6: Reflection

1. Reflect on the differences between static and interactive visualizations.
Static visualizations lile Matplotlib and Seaborn are simple charts that don't change; mostly useful for visualizing reports or basic data summaries and cannot be manipulated by the user.
On the other hand, interactive visualizations like Plotly and Dash allow user intercativity such as hover, zoom, filter and to explore data in real time.

2. Write a short paragraph discussing the advantages of using dashboards for real-time data exploration.
Dashboards make it easier to monitor trends in real time. 
Dash pages are dynamic, in that we can add dropdown lists or other controls to affect what is displayed. 
Users can explore multiple aspects of the data without modifying the source code.

3. Explain how interactive tools like Plotly and Dash can improve data communication in professional settings.
Plotly and Dash provide a professional way to turn raw data into interactive, web-based visualizations. They help make complex data more understandable and users to explore patterns, trends, and outliers on their own. 
In a workplace setting, for example, instead of presenting static charts, professionals can offer dynamic tools that respond to the viewerâ€™s input, making meetings and reports more effective.
